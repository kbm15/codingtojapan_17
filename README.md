# Coding to Japan '17
Hackathon project by that group. We did a renovable energy project for Zaragoza, which included EV panels and a modern 
VR simulation of our solution for the jury.
The Matlab Simulink allows for real solar power simulations in our city, which is necesary to calculate the amount of watts 
EV panels can put out.
